    "Quality of Service (QoS) is the technique of prioritizing traffic flows and providing preferential forwarding for higher-priority packets. The fundamental reason for implementing QoS in your network is to provide better service for certain traffic flows.\n",

    "* Uniform Mode QoS\n",

    "This notebook configures a Service Provider network topology, with 2 Provider-Edge (PE) routers and two Provider (P) router. After the base configuration of OSPF and MPLS is up, the play the notebook code-cells to configure QoS on the ingress and egress interfaces of PE and P routers in the network. The QoS policies ensures that delay sensitive traffic such as voice and video are given high priroity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 traffic generator ports in this network, which represent 2 Customer Edge (CE) routers. A traffic stream with high priority flows from one traffic generator port to the other to simulate the end-customer's video traffic flow across the SP network.\n",

    "In order to ensure high priority for video traffic, the customer marks the video traffic packets with certain values in the packet header. In this case, this notebook sends traffic streams with the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field in the IP header marked for expedited forwarding (EF). Within the PE and P routers in the service-provider network, this notebook will show you how to provide preferential treatment to the marked packets using QoS policies."
